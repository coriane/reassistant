    Could have an Arg0, also:
    John based his corporate headquarters in Philadelphia.
    But that would be a little odd.

<note>
There are some sentences where the arg1 is effectively a VP, such as
&quot;The bond is rated Triple-A based on the quality of the underlying
loans&quot;.  As such, these do not lend themselves to having a nice arg1
annotated, since there is no constituent holding the event (in this
case, the rating) that does not also hold the basing event.  Bummer.
