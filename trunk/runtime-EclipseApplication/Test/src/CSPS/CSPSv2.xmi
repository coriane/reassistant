    <cas:Sofa xmi:id="1" sofaNum="1" sofaID="_InitialView" mimeType="text" sofaString="1. The system places a story in the editor’s &quot;to-do&quot; workflow queue. If more than one editor is defined, a round-robin approach is used to attempt to balance load.   Editors may be marked as unavailable (if, for instance, they are on vacation or sick or out of the office), in which case they will not be included in the round-robin process.&#13;&#10;2. The editor views the story.&#13;&#10;3. The editor categorizes the story by selecting from system-provided categories. There may be more than one category assigned to the story. At least one category must be assigned to the story.&#13;&#10;4. The editor then marks the story as approved.&#13;&#10;5. The system includes the story in the list of available content for paging initiation.&#13;&#10;6. The system triggers initiation of paging messages.&#13;&#10;1. The editor views the story.&#13;&#10;2. The editor marks the story as rejected and describes the reason for rejection.&#13;&#10;3. The system notifies the originator of the content that the story has been rejected and includes the reason provided by the editor.&#13;&#10;4. The system deletes the story.&#13;&#10;1. Editor selects &quot;Modify Story&quot;.&#13;&#10;2. System displays titles of all stories available.&#13;&#10;3. Editor selects specific title.&#13;&#10;4. System displays characteristics of story.&#13;&#10;5. Editor updates characteristics, either deleting some categories, adding other categories, or both.&#13;&#10;6. Editor selects &quot;Save&quot;.&#13;&#10;7. System re-posts the story to the list of available content for paging initiation.&#13;&#10;8. The system triggers initiation of paging messages.&#13;&#10;1. The editor views the advertising content.&#13;&#10;2. The editor marks it approved.&#13;&#10;3. The system includes the advertising content in the list of available advertising for display.&#13;&#10;4. The system creates a preliminary billing record, using information stored about the advertiser (billing rate indicator, advertiser name and billing address), content identification, date, and total due.&#13;&#10;5. The system marks the preliminary billing record as approved.&#13;&#10;1. The editor views the advertising content.&#13;&#10;2. The editor marks it rejected and provides a reason for rejection. This may include account overdue, content inappropriate or not within scope of contract, or duplicate content (advertising content is already on file and being displayed).&#13;&#10;3. The system notifies the advertiser (via email) of the rejection and the reason.&#13;&#10;4. The system deletes the content.&#13;&#10;If the story has been deleted by another editor and is not currently viewable, the use case terminates.&#13;&#10;Editor must be logged in.&#13;&#10;When this use case is complete, content is available. For advertising content, the content will be eligible for display immediately. For story content, the paging process can begin immediately.&#13;&#10;1. User selects &quot;Edit Profile&quot;.&#13;&#10;2. System displays categories of profile (personal, preferences, pager information, &quot;page me when&quot; selections).&#13;&#10;3. User selects category.&#13;&#10;4. If more than one profile exists for a category (for instance, a subscriber may have more than one pager), a list of possible profiles within the category is  presented.&#13;&#10;5. User selects specific profile within category.&#13;&#10;6. System displays detail of specific profile.&#13;&#10;7. User updates detail, presses &quot;OK&quot;.&#13;&#10;8. If information changed includes credit card information, system validates new information with external credit card system.  If information contains pager information, pager PIN format is validated along with email address for sending pages.&#13;&#10;9. System updates subscriber profile.&#13;&#10;If validation of credit card information fails, user is presented with a message indicating failure, and is presented with their profile for update once again.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If this is a new subscriber, the use case &quot;Pay Fee with Credit Card&quot; is invoked following step 9 above.&#13;&#10;For a new subscriber, when this use case is complete, the subscriber is immediately eligible to receive pages.&#13;&#10;This needs to be secured as credit card information may be in the profile.&#13;&#10;1. Subscriber selects &quot;pay fee with credit card&quot;.&#13;&#10;2. System checks to see if user is a current subscriber.  If the user is a new subscriber, a new subscriber ID is generated by the system (using any algorithm that will generate a unique number - this may, for instance, be a continually incrementing number within the system).&#13;&#10;3. System checks to see if current subscriber credit card information is on file.  If it is, user is presented with indicator of credit card on file (using the last four digits of the card number), and asked if this card should be used.&#13;&#10;4. If user declines current card information on file, system prompts subscriber for credit card number, expiration date, and (optionally) PIN.&#13;&#10;5. System verifies that expiration date on credit card has not already passed.&#13;&#10;6. System sends credit card info to external system for charge validation and application.&#13;&#10;7. Upon receipt of validation, system updates subscriber record to indicate new expiration date.&#13;&#10;1. Subscriber selects &quot;pay fee with credit card&quot;.&#13;&#10;2. System displays current credit card information.&#13;&#10;3. User either accepts information as is or updates appropriately.&#13;&#10;4. System sends credit card info to external system for charge validation and application.&#13;&#10;5. Upon receipt of validation, system updates subscriber record to indicate new expiration date.&#13;&#10;If the information provided by the subscriber is not validated by the external system, an error message will be displayed and the subscriber record will NOT be updated (so that the last steps in the above flows will not be executed).  If the credit card has expired, an error message will be displayed and the subscriber record will not be updated.&#13;&#10;User is identified as a subscriber and has a subscriber ID associated with them. For first-time subscribers, a preliminary subscriber entry is made.&#13;&#10;1. Advertiser selects &quot;Print Reports&quot;.&#13;&#10;2. System displays all advertising content provided by advertiser.&#13;&#10;3. Advertiser selects one or more pieces of content on which to report.&#13;&#10;4. System displays a list of reports for this advertiser.  Available reports for each advertiser are based on advertiser contract with WebNewsOnLine, and are part of advertiser profile on file.&#13;&#10;5. Advertiser selects one or more reports to generate.&#13;&#10;6. Advertiser selects format (Word, Excel, or to browser window).&#13;&#10;7. System creates first report and prompts user to save or view.&#13;&#10;8. If advertiser selects &quot;Save&quot;, a message is sent to the browser to initiate a download of the report file.  User interacts with browser to select location for saving the report, and the browser saves the downloaded file.&#13;&#10;9. If advertiser selects &quot;View&quot;, the report is displayed in the browser.&#13;&#10;10. If more reports are available in this session, advertiser then selects another report or terminates the viewing session.&#13;&#10;11. System creates next report and prompts user to save or view.&#13;&#10;12. Bullets 4) through 11) are repeated until no more reports remain.&#13;&#10;User is connected and validated as an advertiser.&#13;&#10;Encryption of the information is not required (issue from Inception phase).&#13;&#10;Obsolete content will be purged after 3 months.&#13;&#10;No reports may be run on purged content.&#13;&#10;1. User selects &quot;Provide Feedback&quot;.&#13;&#10;2. System looks up central user support phone numbers.&#13;&#10;3. System displays phone numbers to call and gives the user the option to send email immediately.&#13;&#10;4. User selects email option.&#13;&#10;5. System looks up email address of customer service and passes it to the browser.&#13;&#10;6. System launches email browser client.&#13;&#10;7. User enters message, presses &quot;Send&quot;.&#13;&#10;8. Browser mail client sends mail.&#13;&#10;1. Advertiser selects &quot;Post Content&quot;.&#13;&#10;2. System validates account billing information to ensure new content will be accepted. This consists of verifying that the advertiser account is in good standing (no outstanding balance over 30 days).&#13;&#10;3. System prompts for name of content.&#13;&#10;4. Advertiser uploads content in GIF format.&#13;&#10;5. System stores GIF in a staging area and records location and name of file.&#13;&#10;6. System acknowledges successful saving of content.&#13;&#10;7. System displays potential categories for ad display. Categories are maintained as a reference list within the system.&#13;&#10;8. Advertiser selects categories for which this ad should be shown.&#13;&#10;9. System displays potential frequencies and prices for the ad. Frequencies are maintained as a reference list, prices are based on advertiser's contract with WebNewsOnLine. Pricing codes are maintained as part of the advertiser profile.&#13;&#10;10. Advertiser selects desired frequency for this ad.&#13;&#10;11. System creates preliminary billing record for this ad based on number of categories selected, frequency, and advertiser's profile.&#13;&#10;12. System places content in editor’s &quot;to-do&quot; workflow queue for approval. If more than one editor is defined, a round-robin approach is used to attempt to balance load. Editors may be marked as unavailable (if, for instance, they are on vacation or sick or out of the office), in which case they will not be included in the round-robin process.&#13;&#10;1. Advertiser selects &quot;Post Content&quot;.&#13;&#10;2. System validates account billing information to ensure new content will be accepted.&#13;&#10;3. Account information is invalid, advertiser is prompted to contact WebNewsOnLine.   System presents central phone number for advertising department (stored in system).&#13;&#10;User is connected and validated as an advertiser.&#13;&#10;Advertiser account exists.&#13;&#10;When this use case is complete, advertising content can be displayed.&#13;&#10;1. System scans &quot;archived&quot; list of content. Content subscribed to remains in a user's &quot;unread&quot; category until the story has been viewed. Once the story has been viewed, the story is marked as &quot;archived&quot; for that subscriber. After two days in the &quot;archived&quot; category, the story is removed from the subscriber's &quot;archived&quot; category. For any stories older than 2 days, the story is moved back into the general category and the reference count attribute of the content object is decremented.&#13;&#10;2. When a story is no longer referenced by any subscribers' &quot;unread&quot; or &quot;archived&quot; category (reference count is 0), the system deletes the story.&#13;&#10;3. System displays banner ads, general content categories, and specific stories for which pages have been sent.&#13;&#10;4. Subscriber views stories.&#13;&#10;5. For any paged stories, the stories are marked as viewed and placed into the &quot;archived&quot; category.&#13;&#10;1. System displays banner ads and general content categories.&#13;&#10;2. System provides the option for the user to subscribe.&#13;&#10;3. User views stories.&#13;&#10;If this content has a pending view count of 0 and the last date viewed is more than 2 days ago, the content is deleted.&#13;&#10;1. Content editor places content on WebNewsOnLine web site (existing system, mechanisms for posting defined by existing system). This currently includes indicating major content category (professional sports, high school sports, collegiate sports, or other).&#13;&#10;2. WebNewsOnLine system checks reference information to determine whether this content category is known by the Collegiate Sports Paging System.&#13;&#10;3. For categories that are known by the Collegiate Sports Paging System, stories are transmitted to the Collegiate Sports Paging System along with category information.&#13;&#10;4. Content is placed into the Collegiate Sports Paging System storage for possible paging.&#13;&#10;If the content is not categorized, the story is placed in the editor’s &quot;to-do&quot; workflow queue.  If more than one editor is defined, a round-robin approach is used to attempt to balance load. Editors may be marked as unavailable (if, for instance, they are on vacation or sick or out of the office), in which case they will not be included in the round-robin process.&#13;&#10;Editor must be logged in.&#13;&#10;When this use case is complete, the &quot;Send Page&quot; use case is invoked.&#13;&#10;1. The flow is initiated when an editor posts content to the system or when new content is received from the existing WebNewsOnLine system.&#13;&#10;2. System checks categories for the new content.&#13;&#10;3. System checks subscriber profiles to determine whether any subscribers wish to be paged for this category of content.&#13;&#10;4. System generates a text message based on the headline.&#13;&#10;5. System constructs a series of email messages.&#13;&#10;6. System sends email messages to subscribers (who will receive these as an alphanumeric page).&#13;&#10;If no headline exists, a system default message is inserted into the email message. The default message is maintained on the system by WebNewsOnLine staff, and there is only one message on the system at any time.&#13;&#10;Content is posted, headline is available, categorization is available.&#13;&#10;1. Potential Subscriber selects &quot;Subscribe&quot; option.&#13;&#10;2. System looks up current contract terms and available service options.&#13;&#10;3. System displays contract terms and service options.&#13;&#10;4. Potential subscriber acknowledges terms and selects service options.&#13;&#10;5. System records currently selected service options.&#13;&#10;6. System displays categories of profile (personal, preferences, pager information, &quot;page me when&quot; selections).&#13;&#10;7. User selects category.&#13;&#10;8. System displays detail of category.&#13;&#10;9. User updates detail, presses &quot;OK&quot;.&#13;&#10;10. System validates data as required, updates subscriber profile.&#13;&#10;If the potential subscriber does not acknowledge the contract terms, the use case terminates.&#13;&#10;New subscriber is recorded in the system and may receive pages immediately.&#13;&#10;The system will not require user training beyond that of using a web browser. This will be verified by usability tests during the beta period.&#13;&#10;The system will be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.&#13;&#10;The system will be able to support 200,000 subscribers, and provide a scaling mechanism to handle 500,000 subscribers.&#13;&#10;When a news story is posted to the system, pages must be transmitted to the pager gateway within 5 minutes.&#13;&#10;The subscriber shall be able to utilize the system through commercially available browser software. No custom software will be required to reside on the subscriber’s PC.&#13;&#10;The system shall conform with existing WebNewsOnLine web site design standards.&#13;&#10;The system shall communicate with the existing WebNewsOnLine web site for the purpose of receiving story content.&#13;&#10;The system will interconnect with the existing WebNewsOnLine system to receive content.&#13;&#10;"/>
