# Crosscutting visualizations #

REAssistant helps analysts to analyze the effects of crosscutting concerns on use cases by means of two views: global and detailed visualizations. These views provide insights about crosscutting behaviors at different levels.

## Global visualization ##

The global view shows an outlook of the crosscutting concerns on all the documents. In this view, the analyst can see approximate places in which the crosscutting concerns affect the documents, but not the text actually involved.

## Detailed visualization ##

The detailed view shows a visualization at the level of setences, targetting a single document. Thus, in this view, the analyst can appreciate the text affected by each crosscutting concern.
